## Additional Functionalities

1. Unless or until any user is signed in, the buy now functionality wonâ€™t work and they'll be redirected to the login page.

2. If any user tries to access the admin panel or tries to add/update/delete a product by guessing the URL, he will be stopped and an appropriate message will be shown.
